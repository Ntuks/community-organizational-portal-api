# Community Organizational Portal API
The web app allow community organisations to upload a profile of what they do, including what geographical area they work in and what social issues they work on into a database. This backend API for the web application is built in TypeScript. The web app also allows that information to be mapped using Google Maps. It allows a user to see all the community organisations working in a particular geographical area, or see all the organisations working on a particular social issue.
