The system allows community organisations to upload a profile of what they do, including what geographical area they work in and what social issues they work on into a database. . The system also allows that information to be mapped using Google Maps. It allows a user to see all the community organisations working in a particular geographical area, or see all the organisations working on a particular social issue.
